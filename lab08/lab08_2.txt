Answers to the reactJS lab questions. 
a)
	i. The component structure of the application has layers that can be rendered into HTML.  These layers can 
	build off of eachother and offer a much more dynamic frontend.  React being composable means that it doesn't 
	have to be built out of basic html, but it can return a tree of component layers.
	ii.  JSX rewrites HTML tags based on the components that were created so global namespace doesn't get duplicates.
	iii.  XSS is a security vulnerability where HTML code is injected into the server, and react protects against it 
	because it doesn't generate HTML strings.  
	iv.  The components are created in a tree, where it starts off with the most complex thing, in this case the 
	comment box, and then adds the components that it needs, for example in this case that would be the comment 
	list and comment form.  It then adds the components that those need, for example comment list needs the comment
	component.
	v.  Props are immutable, which means they can only be edited by the parent they are passed to, while states can be
	edited by anyone.  These are both used to pass data between methods.
b)
	i.  If you add or remove a legal comment and save it, it will update the webpage with that comment.  If you add a 
	illegal comment it just wont show any of the comments.
	ii.  It calls render because it sets the polling rate for the server and converts some of the react code to 
	something the server can read.
	iii.  It helps it load faster because it doesn't have to grab the state of the view again.
	iv.  If it decides the new comment is illegal then it will either crash or show nothing.
