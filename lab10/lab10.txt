Compare and contrast MongoDB and the SQL databases you’ve used before. Are there things that one can do that the other can’t?
	They are built differently, MongoDB being a document structure making it better for speedy gets across a large area, while SQL 
	is table based and is made for more industial pourposes where speed isnt as important.  SQL can join tables while MongoDB can store JSON data.

You could run MongoDB locally. What advantages and/or disadvantages would that bring with respect to the cloud database you have now?
	The cloud is always running while a local version would only be on when your computer was on.

You’ve built a “sandbox” database on mLab. Could you use this for a production database? Why or why not?
	No, because it is only made for testing apps.  It cant store that much data and is only in one place. 

For this integration of mLab into your application, was it better to run the modified server (npm start) or the full Webpack development environment (npm run dev)? Why?
	I found it better to use dev due to it automatically updating to changes.

Explain what happens when you modify the database using mLab’s web interface rather than your application? Try adding/updating/deleting comment documents.
	It achives the same functionality.  Since the app is polling it every 2 seconds, it doesnt matter how or where the changes were made, it will 
	always grab them.  This is useful across multiple devices.

Is this comments application the sort of application that should use an SQL or a noSQL database? Explain your answer.
	This should use a noSQL DB because it can do speedy, light data tranfers, that wouldnt benifit from the extra structure of SQL.
