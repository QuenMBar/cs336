Compare and contrast your development and production deployments and explain how each is designed.
	Prduction doesnt have the dev plugin and had a few optimization plugins instead.

List the optimizations you’ve configured for this production version and, if possible, find evidence of then in the deployed application files.
	new webpack.optimize.OccurenceOrderPlugin(),
        new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin(),

	These are the 2 optimiztions.  There for turning the JS into more efficient code by condensing it into a form that 
	is fuctional, just not very readable.

What advantage is there is deploying an application to a PaaS tool like Heroku?
	The app will always be running and with git it is easy to update it.  Heroku makes it so its easy to give your 
	app a url that anyone can access.

How does Heroku know how to install and run your application (after pulling it from the specified branch on GitHub)?
	It know by looking at the package.json and the webpack.  Once it learns that NPM is being used, it uses the 
	package.json to install and run the app.

Include the URL of your deployed Heroku service here.
