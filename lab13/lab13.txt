What benefit did using the React Router bring to the application?
	It makes it much eaiser to specify routes and give them react files to run.

Which is better, hash history or browser history?
	Browser history uses the browser to remember whats been clicked on before, and hash history uses a hash stored after the 
	URL to remember whats been clicked on before.

Why does the server (either Webpack Dev Server or the Express server) have to be modified to support the browser history? Compare this with the hash-based server demonstrated in class, which didn't require such modifications.
	This is because it is now the server and browser remembering where its been, instead of just a string that the server interperates.

What state does the new CommentEdit component maintain and how does that compare with the state maintained by the CommentBox component?
	It manages a state of a single comment thats being edited, while CommentBox is maintaining the status of all the comments.

What does the CommentEdit component do when the AJAX PUT or DELETE methods return successfully? How does this compare with what the “Cancel” button provided by the CommentEdit component does?
	It just makes the user return to the main page by using a push function.  The cancel button is just a link back to the main page.

How is the Link added in the last step different from a simple HTML hyperlink?
	It refernces another react component.
