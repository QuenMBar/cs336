	A project I could work on would be a website for textbook exchanging and selling between students.  This was an idea that 
one person in my Software Engineering group had, but we ditched because making a log in system seemed too complicated for that 
class.  However, I think that this could be a very good product if done correctly.  
	It would be comprised of a home screen to explain what it is, and then links to a log in page.  From this, you would log 
in and could access books being sold or put one up to be sold through a form.  Depending on the amount of time, stretch goals 
would be making the log in more secure, and instead of having the data being stored in ram, put it on an external database server.
